# Who's Free? — Web App v8

A privacy-first static web app for comparing Omnivox schedules.

Import compatible Omnivox timetable PDFs or screenshots from your school, or enter schedules manually. PDF recognition depends on the timetable format; always review imported times before saving.

## Fork updates — last updated October 5, 2026

Fork improvements by **Hui En Qian**. Open the [live fork](https://hui3412.github.io/Whos-Free/).

### Summary

- **Cleaner design:** Subtle filled backgrounds, compact mobile controls and automatic scrolling to newly opened panels.
- **Image recognition:** On-device English/French OCR for timetable screenshots, including repeated half-hour boundary labels, hourly start/end rows, abbreviated dated weekday headings and coloured class blocks, with independent retries and warnings for uncertain detections.
- **Timetable editor:** Create schedules manually or correct imported and saved schedules in a seven-day grid.
- **Availability:** Check now or preview another time, including weekends, with real breaks and next-class details.
- **Groups:** Overlapping memberships, live free counts, shared-break suggestions and weekly availability.
- **Saved ordering:** Independent person orders for each list, pinned people first, and **Send group to top**.
- **Undo:** Reverse schedule and order changes during the current page session.
- **Sharing:** PDF/JSON imports, JSON backups and self-contained codes with exact duplicate checks and a choice for conflicting schedules.
- **Semester labels:** Identify older timetables and update their term without changing classes.

These three milestones group the completed work chronologically; their labels are separate from the app's package and cache versions.

### Version 49 — Coloured intensive-class border detection

- Checked ten additional supplied timetable pictures, including Saturday classes, tall screenshots, cropped empty final rows, and explicit intensive-class time ranges.
- Fixed an overlapping duplicate caused by JPEG ringing around a wide title inside a purple class. A candidate grid line must now also have contrast in the padding at at least one column edge. Slightly off-center weekday headings and genuine tinted borders remain supported.
- Added raster regressions for dense titles, tinted compression stripes, real coloured borders, off-center columns, and explicit end times beyond a printed row end. Course wording still requires review.

### Version 48 — Public Omnivox timetable regression coverage

- Tested five distinct public Omnivox timetables from LaSalle/LCI guides, Sainte-Foy and Trois-Rivières, across nine image variants. Eight variants reproduced all visible busy intervals. The remaining tiny, annotated guide-page screenshot still fails with a clear error; its original embedded timetable image works.
- Added abbreviated English/French weekday and date-heading recognition, a focused heading retry, and conservative recovery of one unreadable internal weekday when four aligned headings including Monday and Friday remain visible.
- Recognize hourly start/end rows such as 08:00–08:50 without doubling the time scale. Preserve irregular final rows such as 16:55–17:45 and their local physical boundaries.
- Avoid false busy blocks caused by dark column edges while accepting faint gray course text. Numbered schedule-configuration grids are not treated as ordinary timetable screenshots.
- Regression fixtures contain only weekday/time labels and OCR coordinates, not public schedule pictures, student identities, or course text. The four supplied cropped and uncropped half-hour examples remain covered.
- These checks cover busy times, not perfect transcription. Small, blurry or annotated pictures can still fail or produce uncertain wording; always compare the review grid with the picture before saving. OCR remains on-device.

### Reader 51 — Validated on-device fallbacks and complete-axis checks

October 8, 2026

- Reproduced a supplied phone screenshot failing in the deployed browser even though the matching native OCR test passed. Browser imports are now included in verification; matching OCR engine/model versions alone do not guarantee identical rasterization or results.
- Added a second layout-reading mode, focused/enlarged heading retries, and independent sparse/contrast-enhanced time-gutter retries. Temporary retry canvases are bounded and released immediately.
- Added a second half-hour axis method: at least eight distinct readable clock labels must agree with a consistent lattice of visible time-gutter borders. This handles omitted duplicate boundary labels without manufacturing OCR observations. Middle-of-row configuration labels and inconsistent clocks remain rejected.
- Browser verification exposed a second issue: a consistent subset of clock labels could end at 14:30 while the visible grid continued to 18:00. Check for continuing physical gutter rows and missing leading rows before accepting any axis; incomplete readings trigger dedicated full-column retries instead of cropping away later classes.
- Retry empty/low-quality class text, keeping one complete OCR pass rather than mixing conflicting course codes. Unreadable individual busy spans remain editable; pictures where most detected blocks remain unreadable are rejected instead of presenting a mostly unverified schedule.
- Label border-recovered times for review, add reader/stage information to errors, and time out stalled OCR jobs. Picture imports release the large source canvas after cropping the timetable to reduce peak retained memory.
- No remote OCR, new external service, or schedule-file upload was added. The existing review/confirmation, name-entry, editing and scrolling flows are preserved.

### Version 12.1 — Image recognition and timetable editing

October 2, 2026

- Added on-device English/French OCR for JPG/JPEG, PNG and WebP timetable pictures, without sending pictures to an OCR server or AI API.
- Added a seven-day review grid, manual schedule creation and editing of saved timetables.
- Allowed class blocks to be added, corrected or removed, with course details optional and canceled edits leaving saved data unchanged.
- Improved faint-border and time-column detection, wrapped room/instructor text and common room-label OCR errors.
- Preserved unfamiliar, unreadable and merged entries as editable busy spans, including athlete/conflict blocks and weekend classes.
- Showed breaks in the review grid, merged overlapping busy periods and excluded passing gaps of **10 minutes or less** from free time.
- Added next-real-break times to person cards.
- Bundled and cached OCR files for later offline use on supported browsers.

Use a clear, upright picture with the full timetable, borders, times and weekday headings visible. Uncropped screenshots are supported: after locating the time axis and weekday columns, the detector automatically isolates the timetable before reading classes, excluding surrounding page content. Manual cropping can still help when the timetable is too small or blurry. Review recognized times and text before saving; image-only PDFs should use the picture importer. Deploy the root app files and complete `assets/ocr/` folder over HTTPS or `http://localhost`. Offline recognition requires cached OCR files and retained browser storage.

### Version 12.2 — Sharing, groups and schedule Undo

October 2–5, 2026, before the visual overhaul

- Added selected-schedule sharing and pasted-code import, then shortened codes with compact times, compression and dense Unicode encoding.
- Initially compared same-name imports by weekly busy-time overlap; Version 12.3 replaces this rule with exact checks and explicit conflict choices.
- Added overlapping groups, live free counts, shared-break suggestions and weekly availability.
- Added an **8:15 AM–8:05 PM** group grid, weekend columns when needed, darker blocks for more free people and exact names/times on selection.
- Smoothed short group-grid transitions without changing the original intervals used for shared-break suggestions.
- Added **Undo** for saves, edits, renames, imports and removals, restoring affected preferences and memberships.
- Retained **20 changes per page session**, excluding canceled, invalid and unchanged operations.
- Optimized availability calculations, duplicate comparisons and group-calendar processing.
- Added fork-improvement credit beside the original creator.

Copy complete share codes, including special characters. Earlier alphanumeric codes must be regenerated. Reloading clears Undo history, not saved schedules; finish or cancel an editor or code panel before undoing.

### Version 12.3 — Cleaner interface and saved personalization

October 5, 2026, from the visual overhaul onward

- Replaced outlined containers with clean filled backgrounds while retaining the layout, Settings, themes, notifications and personalization.
- Automatically revealed newly opened editors, picture reviews, import/export panels and group details, respecting reduced-motion preferences.
- Placed weekday and time fields side by side without visible labels and matched their heights, including on iPhone.
- Allowed edits during live mode to switch to a manual preview; **Use current time** restores live updates.
- Moved **Use current time** beside All/Free and Groups, removed Refresh, combined the class/free counts and saved the All/Free selection across reloads.
- Added automatic and editable Fall/Winter labels to new and previously unlabeled schedules.
- Showed only older semesters on main cards, greyed them out and added **Use current semester** without changing class times.
- Added compact recognition warnings that survive saving, reopening and Undo.
- Added **Replace**, **Keep both** and **Cancel** for same-name picture uploads, ignoring case and repeated spaces.
- Changed code imports to automatically add different names and skip only identical names and timetables; other same-name schedules offer **Keep both**, **Replace** or **Keep old one**.
- Made code-import choices apply separately to each conflict, with one Undo for the completed batch and no save until all choices are finished.
- Added mouse dragging, touch hold-and-drag and **Alt + Up/Down** person reordering, with independent saved orders for the main list, each group and Ungrouped.
- Preserved hidden people and positions across filters, reloads and renames; kept pinned people above unpinned people while allowing moves within either section.
- Removed drag grips and kept ordinary phone swipes from starting accidental reorders.
- Replaced the group checkbox checklist with **Hide/Show**, retaining collapsed headers, counts and menus.
- Added **Send group to top**, saved group order/collapse states and fixed clipped menus when every group is collapsed.
- Extended Undo to person/group order changes without changing schedules, other orders or collapse states.
- Reorganized Schedules, added the Omnivox optimization note, replaced school-specific wording and improved the fork documentation.
- Updated app caches while retaining OCR assets and added warnings when reordered positions cannot be saved.

Semester defaults use fixed approximate windows: Winter **December 23–May 31**, Fall **June 1–December 22**; labels can be changed or cleared. JSON and new share codes preserve semester labels; semester-aware codes require an updated app. JSON also retains OCR warnings, but share codes omit review markers. Groups, person orders and Undo history remain local and are not exported.

Code-import names are matched without case or repeated spaces. Exact timetable checks compare class days, times, course details and semester labels, ignoring class order, source files and local OCR warnings. **Keep both** adds the next unused numbered name, such as David 2; **Replace** retains the original name and local preferences; **Keep old one** leaves that schedule unchanged. Escape selects **Keep old one** for the current conflict.

The original version and deployment notes follow below.

## What's new in v8

- Fixed the iPhone time-control overflow by stacking Day and Time on narrow screens and removing Safari's stubborn native minimum width.
- Light/dark controls remain in **Settings → Themes**.
- Five saved full-app theme templates: **Ocean, Lavender, Rose, Forest, and Sunset**. Each recolors backgrounds, panels, cards, inputs, buttons, borders, timelines, badges and accents.
- Per-person **nicknames** that replace the full name throughout the main UI and notifications.
- Per-person **pins** so favorites stay at the top of the list.
- Existing break-notification bells remain available beside pin controls.
- More subtle GSAP polish: app entrance, settings-section stagger, theme selection, refresh feedback, pin interactions, plus the existing card/detail/timeline/toast animations.
- Mobile settings cards now stack cleanly with 44px-ish touch targets and no horizontal page overflow.
- Service-worker cache bumped to **v8**.

## Privacy model

Schedule PDFs and `schedules.json` stay on the user's device. The app stores the local schedule database in IndexedDB (with a localStorage fallback).

The hosted GitHub Pages site does **not** need a `schedules.json` file.

PDF parsing happens in the browser. PDF.js is loaded from jsDelivr only when a user adds a PDF; the selected PDF itself is not uploaded by the app.

Nicknames, pins, color theme, notification settings, and muted bells are device-specific local preferences. They are **not** included when sharing `schedules.json`.

## People personalization

Open **Settings → People** to:

- type a nickname (clear it to return to the full name),
- tap **📌** to pin or unpin someone,
- tap **🔔 / 🔕** to control only that person's break notifications.

Pinned people appear first. In **Show everyone**, pinned people are kept at the top even if one is currently in class.

## Themes

Open **Settings → Themes** to choose light/dark mode and a full color theme:

- Light or Dark mode
- Ocean
- Lavender
- Rose
- Forest
- Sunset

Theme settings are remembered locally on that device.

## Notifications

When enabled, Who's Free? looks for breaks between two classes where the gap is **more than 10 minutes**. Time before the first class and after the last class is not treated as a break.

If several unmuted people start a qualifying break in the same minute, Who's Free? sends one grouped notification.

### Current limitation

This is still a static GitHub Pages app. Break alerts are checked while the app is open/running. A static site cannot reliably wake itself later after the browser/PWA has been fully closed.

On iPhone, users should add Who's Free? to the Home Screen for the best notification support.

## Files to deploy

Upload these to the **root** of the GitHub repository:

```text
index.html
app.js
schedule-parser.js
styles.css
service-worker.js
manifest.webmanifest
assets/
```

Do **not** upload `schedules.json`.

GitHub Pages:

```text
Branch: main
Folder: / (root)
```

## Updating an existing install

v8 uses versioned files and `whos-free-shell-v8`, so previous installs should update automatically after GitHub Pages redeploys.

If a device still shows an older version, close the page/Home Screen app completely and reopen it.

## GSAP

GSAP 3.13.0 is loaded from jsDelivr and is used only for small UI transitions. The app still works if GSAP fails to load. Users with **Reduce Motion** enabled do not get the motion effects.

## Sharing

The **Share schedules.json** button shares/downloads only the schedule database. Device-specific preferences such as nicknames, pins, theme, notification settings, muted bells, and notification history are not included.

## v9 changes

- The browser PDF parser now recognizes Omnivox schedules in **English or French**.
  - Weekdays such as `Monday` / `Lundi`, `Tuesday` / `Mardi`, `Wednesday` / `Mercredi`, `Thursday` / `Jeudi`, and `Friday` / `Vendredi` are normalized to the same internal weekday names.
  - Room labels accept English `Classroom` plus French forms such as `Local`, `Classe`, and `Salle de classe`.
  - Section labels accept `sec.`, `sect.`, and `section`.
  - Time text accepts both `08:15` and French-style `08 h 15`, including ranges using `à`.
- Shared `schedules.json` files now carry the Who's Free? website URL (`https://xander444.github.io/Whos-Free/`).
- On devices with the Web Share API, the share sheet includes the website link alongside the JSON file.
