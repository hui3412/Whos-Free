# Who's Free? — Web App v7

A privacy-first static web app for comparing Marianopolis schedules.

## What's new in v7

- Fixed narrow-phone overflow around time/status bubbles and timeline time labels.
- Light/dark mode controls moved into **Settings → Appearance**.
- Five saved accent-theme templates: **Blue, Violet, Rose, Mint, and Orange**.
- Per-person **nicknames** that replace the full name throughout the main UI and notifications.
- Per-person **pins** so favorites stay at the top of the list.
- Existing break-notification bells remain available beside pin controls.
- More subtle GSAP polish: app entrance, settings-section stagger, theme selection, refresh feedback, pin interactions, plus the existing card/detail/timeline/toast animations.
- Mobile settings cards now stack cleanly with 44px-ish touch targets and no horizontal page overflow.
- Service-worker cache bumped to **v7**.

## Privacy model

Schedule PDFs and `schedules.json` stay on the user's device. The app stores the local schedule database in IndexedDB (with a localStorage fallback).

The hosted GitHub Pages site does **not** need a `schedules.json` file.

PDF parsing happens in the browser. PDF.js is loaded from jsDelivr only when a user adds a PDF; the selected PDF itself is not uploaded by the app.

Nicknames, pins, accent theme, notification settings, and muted bells are device-specific local preferences. They are **not** included when sharing `schedules.json`.

## People personalization

Open **Settings → People** to:

- type a nickname (clear it to return to the full name),
- tap **📌** to pin or unpin someone,
- tap **🔔 / 🔕** to control only that person's break notifications.

Pinned people appear first. In **Show everyone**, pinned people are kept at the top even if one is currently in class.

## Appearance

Open **Settings → Appearance** to choose:

- Light or Dark mode
- Blue
- Violet
- Rose
- Mint
- Orange

Appearance settings are remembered locally on that device.

## Notifications

When enabled, Who's Free? looks for breaks between two classes where the gap is **more than 10 minutes**. Time before the first class and after the last class is not treated as a break.

If several unmuted people start a qualifying break in the same minute, Who's Free? sends one grouped notification.

### Current limitation

This is still a static GitHub Pages app. Break alerts are checked while the app is open/running. A static site cannot reliably wake itself later after the browser/PWA has been fully closed.

On iPhone, users should add Who's Free? to the Home Screen for the best notification support.

## Files to deploy

Upload these to the **root** of the GitHub repository:

```text
index.html
app.js
schedule-parser.js
styles.css
service-worker.js
manifest.webmanifest
assets/
```

Do **not** upload `schedules.json`.

GitHub Pages:

```text
Branch: main
Folder: / (root)
```

## Updating an existing install

v7 uses versioned files and `whos-free-shell-v7`, so previous installs should update automatically after GitHub Pages redeploys.

If a device still shows an older version, close the page/Home Screen app completely and reopen it.

## GSAP

GSAP 3.13.0 is loaded from jsDelivr and is used only for small UI transitions. The app still works if GSAP fails to load. Users with **Reduce Motion** enabled do not get the motion effects.

## Sharing

The **Share schedules.json** button shares/downloads only the schedule database. Device-specific preferences such as nicknames, pins, theme, notification settings, muted bells, and notification history are not included.
